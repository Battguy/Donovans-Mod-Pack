<--- WELCOME TO DONOVANS MODS --->

--- fabric api ---
I'd recommend always keeping this in, as it is a dependency for MANY MANY mods.

--- iris ---
This is necessary if you want to use shaders. If you hate it when things look good, don't use this mod.

--- sodium ---
This is a REALLY REALLY good performance boosting mod. If you hate frames, don't use this mod. (It works seamlessly with iris, allowing shaders to run at more reasonable frame rates)

--- distant horizons ---
This mod is peak. You should use this mod. It allows you to see farther, while also boosting your frame rates. If you hate being able to use your eyes, don't use this mod. (If you are wondering how it works, try googling 'LODs' or 'Levels of Detail')

--- tweakeroo ---
This mod has an insane amount of features. Notable mentions are elytra swapping keybind, ability to auto swap tools out of your hand before they break, and many more. If you use this mod, please don't enable any NEFARIOUS settings, keep things reasonable. If you hate improving your QOL, don't use this mod.

--- sound physics remastered ---
This mod changes the way things sound. It makes them sound more HD, however certain things are quite different to the way they sound in vanilla, so it may take a little while to get used to. If you hate using your ears, don't install this mod.

--- Xaeros minimap & worldmap ---
These mods add a customizable minimap, and a full world map which can be viewed via a keybind, respectively. Its really nice for viewing big builds or looking at places you've visted. If you love using all of your hotbar slots for maps, don't install these mods.

--- chat heads ---
This mod adds heads to the Minecraft chat (the head of the speaking players skin). It is a very minor change, but it seriously enhances the chatting experience. If you hate head, don't install this mod.

--- stfu ---
Adds some minor QOL improvements, more subtle than tweakeroos. It adds an option that increases visible chat history so no matter how many messages are sent, you can always view them. As well as various other very minor QOL things. If you hate yourself, don't install this mod.

--- zoomify ---
Adds the ability to zoom in on the screen by pressing a single button. Once you zoom in, you can also use your scroll wheel to zoom even further. If you have an irrational love for having the telescope in your hotbar, you can also use the scroll wheel while in the telescope to enhance the telescopes zoom. If you love lifting your monitor up and mashing it against your eyeballs, don't install this mod. (NOTE: tweakeroo also comes with far a LESS customizable/premium zoom which you can alternatively use.)

--- Euphoria Patcher ---
This mod adds some enhancements to a specific shader pack "Complementary Shaders". If you hate complementary shaders, don't install this mod.

--- authme ---
Not at all necessary most of the time. I do recommend just leaving it in your mods folder, as it is occasionally extremely convenient.

--- mod menu ---
Adds the ability to edit your mods settings all in one convenient place. If you hate mods, don't install this mod.

--- screencopy ---
When you take a screenshot in game via the F2 key, it will also copy it to your clipboard. This allows for easy posting of screenshots in discord. If you have no friends to share images with, don't install this mod.

--- intemscroller ---
Gives some advanced features for bulk item crafting, moving, etc. It has some really handy keybinds none of which I remember at the time of writing this! Check out the keybinds here: https://modrinth.com/mod/item-scroller
If you hate crafting many many MANY MANNNNY things, and handling many many MANY MANNNNY items, install this mod. (it makes it so much freaking easier)

--- YetAnotherConfigLib ---
Dependency for zoomify.

--- fabric language kotlin ---
Dependency for zoomify.


--- malilib ---
Dependency for tweakeroo.

--- cloth config ---
Dependency for sound physics remastered. (Its an OPTIONAL dependency, I have NO CLUE what the difference is with/without it, so remove at your own discretion when using sound physics remastered)

--- placeholder api ---
Dependency for mod menu.
